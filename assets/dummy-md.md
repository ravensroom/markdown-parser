# **Introduction**

This document explains the use of *Markdown syntax* in answering questions.

## **Why Use Markdown Syntax?**
Markdown syntax allows you to add formatting like **headers**, *italics*, **bold** and **bulleted lists** to plain text. 

## **Examples**

Here's how to format with Markdown:

- To **bold** text, surround it with double asterisks ( `**bold**` ).

- For *italic* text, use single asterisks or underscores ( `*italic*` or `_italic_` ).

- To create a [link](https://www.google.com), use the format `[text](url)` ( `[link](https://www.google.com)` )

- To quote text, start the line with a ">" ( `> This is a quote` )

- To write in `code`, surround the text with backticks ( ``` `code` ``` )

- For headings, start the line with "#" ( `# H1, ## H2, ### H3` )

- To create unordered list (or bullet points), start the line with "*" ( `* bullet` )

Try out these formats in your next Markdown document!

> Remember: Practice makes perfect.

## **Conclusion**
Once familiar, Markdown can be a simple and powerful tool for formatting text. Happy coding!

gather-sdk.js:7670 Sure, here's a simple example of JavaScript code in markdown syntax:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet('World'));
```

In markdown, you can wrap your code around with three backticks (\```) and specify the language right after the first three backticks for syntax highlight, in this case, 'javascript'.
gather-sdk.js:7670 Sure, here is an example of a table written in Markdown:

```
| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |
```

When rendered, this would appear as:

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |

```js
console.log('hello')
```

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Its syntax is simple and easy to learn which is one of the many reasons why it's so popular, especially among developers.

If you want to **emphasize** your text, you can use the *italic* syntax, for more emphasis, use the **bold** syntax, or even __underline__ syntax.

Here is an example:

```
*This text would be italicized in markdown*
**This text would be bold in markdown**
__This text would be underlined in markdown__
```

If you wanted to include [links](https://google.com), you would use the following syntax:

```
[Google](https://google.com)
```

For a more 'code-like' syntax, use the backticks:

```
`This would appear as code in markdown`
```

Here's how you use quotations:

```
> This is a famous quote
```

Creating lists is also very easy in markdown:

```
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
```

And here's how to make a numbered list:

```
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
```

Markdown is also great for creating headers. For example:

```
# This is a Heading 1
## This is a Heading 2
### This is a Heading 3
```

And let's not forget about the ability to create tables:

```
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
| Data 3   | Data 4   |
```

In Conclusion, Markdown is a great way to format text quickly and efficiently, whether you're working on a GitHub readme, writing a blog post, or writing documentation, Markdown can save you time and make your text look great!
